## Project goals ##
Writing stories can be a lot of fun. But what if you could write stories with complete strangers? In this app you can start a new story or add to an existing story. This way, you'll never know what is going to happen, making writing both more challenging and fun!

## Design Choices ##
I have based the designs for this website on the image used for the hero header. I wanted to create an atmosphere of warmth and welcome any user to join the fun.

### Colors ###
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for creating a color scheme.

![Color scheme](/assets/wireframes/colorscheme.png)

* #F8F8FF: This is a more off white color, to keep the more darker toned colors together and create a more warming atmosphere. This will be the background color.
* #000000: This will be the main font color. 
* #BC5609: This will be the font color for the logo and the titles on the homepage.
* 5F2121: This will be the color of the lines and borders.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient. This way my content will be easily readable.
### Fonts ###
The fonts Iâ€™ll be using are:

[Indie Flower:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower?query=Indie) For the logo, header and titles

[Raleway:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway) For the content

Fonts are from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Icons ###
Icons used are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) The are used in moderation and match the colors and overall feel of the design.

### Structure ###
For the structure I have used [Bulma.](https://bulma.io/) I wanted to challenge myself to not use Bootstrap (as I have done in former projects) or Materialize, but found it important (and fun!) to use something completely different. 

## Wireframes, Flowcharts and Data Models ##

### Wireframes ###

For wireframing I have used [Pencil.](https://pencil.evolus.vn/)

You can find my wireframes below:

**Desktop Wireframes:**

**Tablet Wireframes:**|

**Mobile Wireframes:**

### Flowcharts ###
I have decided to make a flowchart for the sign-in / register / delete account / change username and/or password process to completely understand each step of the process.

I have used !!!!! to make this flowchart which you can view below:

![Flowchart]()

### Data Models ###
I also created a conceptual data model to get a feel for the needed entities, relationships and attributes, which have also helped me form the user stories.

#### Database Structure ####
For this project I have used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) with the following collections:

## Deployment ##

### Local Deployment ###
I have created Story Chain using Github, from there I used Gitpod to write my code. Then I used commits to git followed by "git push" to my GitHub repository. I've deployed this project to Heroku and used "git push heroku master" to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku.

This project can be ran locally by following the following steps: ( I used Gitpod for development, so the following steps will be specific to Gitpod. You will need to adjust them depending on your IDE. You can find more information about installing packages using pip and virtual environments [here](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

**To clone the project:**

    1. From the application's repository, click the "code" button and download the zip of the repository. Alternatively, you can clone the repository using the following line in your terminal:
       git clone https://github.com/byIlsa/story-chain.git
    2. Access the folder in your terminal window and install the application's required modules using the following command:
       pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    3. Sign-in or sign-up to MongoDB and create a new cluster
        â—¦ Within the Sandbox, click the collections button and after click Create Database (Add My Own Data) called story_chain
        â—¦ Set up the following collections: users, dogs, logs, food_metrics and weight Click here to see the exact Database Structure
          
        â—¦ Under the Security Menu on the left, select Database Access.
        â—¦ Add a new database user, and keep the credentials secure
        â—¦ Within the Network Access option, add IP Address 0.0.0.0
    4. In your IDE, create a file containing your environmental variables called env.py at the root level of the application. It will need to contain the following lines and variables:
       import os
       
       os.environ["IP"] = "0.0.0.0"
       os.environ["PORT"] = "5000"
       os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
       os.environ["DEBUG"] = "True"
       os.environ["MONGO_URI"] = "YOUR_MONGODB_URI"
       os.environ["MONGO_DBNAME"]= "DATABASE_NAME" 
       Please note that you will need to update the SECRET_KEY with your own secret key, as well as the MONGO_URI and MONGO_DBNAME variables with those provided by MongoDB. Tip for your SECRET_KEY, you can use a Password Generator in order to have a secure secret key. I personlly recommend a length of 24 characters and exclude Symbols. To find your MONGO_URI, go to your clusters and click on connect. Choose connect your application and copy the link provided. Don't forget to update the necessary fields like password and database name.
       If you plan on pushing this application to a public repository, ensure that env.py is added to your .gitignore file.
    5. The application can now be run locally. In your terminal, type the following command
       python3 app.py.

**To deploy your project on Heroku, use the following steps:**

    1. Login to your Heroku account and create a new app. Choose your region.
    2. Ensure the Procfile and requirements.txt files exist are present and up-to-date in your local repository.

**Requirements:**

       pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

**Procfile:**

       echo web: python app.py > Procfile

    3. The Procfile should contain the following line:
       web: python app.py

**And then:**       

    4. Scroll down to "deployment method"-section. Choose "Github" for automatic deployment.
    5. From the inputs below, make sure your github user is selected, and then enter the name for your repo. Click "search". When it finds the repo, click the "connect" button.
    6. Scroll back up and click "settings". Scroll down and click "Reveal config vars". Set up the same variables as in your env.py (IP, PORT, SECRET_KEY, MONGO_URI and MONGODB_NAME): !You shouldn't set the DEBUG variable in under config vars, only in your env.py to prevent DEBUG being active on live website.
       IP = 0.0.0.0
       PORT = 5000
       SECRET_KEY = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
       MONGO_URI = YOUR_MONGODB_URI
       MONGO_DBNAME = DATABASE_NAME
    7. Scroll back up and click "Deploy". Scroll down and click "Enable automatic deployment".
    8. Just beneath, click "Deploy branch". Heroku will now start building the app. When the build is complete, click "view app" to open it.
    9. In order to commit your changes to the branch, use git push to push your changes.
