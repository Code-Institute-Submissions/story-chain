# Story Chain #
*So you think you can write?*

## Project goals ##
Writing stories can be a lot of fun. But what if you could write stories with complete strangers? In this app you can start a new story or add to an existing story. This way, you'll never know what is going to happen, making writing both more challenging and fun!

## Design Choices ##
I have based the designs for this website on the image used for the hero header. I wanted to create an atmosphere of warmth and welcome any user to join the fun.

### Colors ###
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) for creating a color scheme.

![Color scheme](/assets/wireframes/colorscheme.png)

* #F8F8FF: This is a more off white color, to keep the more darker toned colors together and create a more warming atmosphere. This will be the background color.
* #000000: This will be the main font color. 
* #BC5609: This will be the font color for the logo and the titles on the homepage.
* 5F2121: This will be the color of the lines and borders.

I have used a contrast checker in order to make sure that the contrast is sufficient. This way my content will be easily readable.
### Fonts ###
The fonts Iâ€™ll be using are:

[Indie Flower:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Indie+Flower?query=Indie) For the logo, header and titles

[Raleway:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway) For the content

Fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

### Icons ###
Icons used are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/) The are used in moderation and match the colors and overall feel of the design.

### Structure ###
For the structure I have used [Bulma.](https://bulma.io/) I wanted to challenge myself to not use Bootstrap (as I have done in former projects) or Materialize, but found it important (and fun!) to use something completely different. 

## Wireframes, Flowcharts and Data Models ##

### Wireframes ###

For wireframing I have used [Pencil.](https://pencil.evolus.vn/)

You can find my wireframes below:

**Desktop Wireframes:**

**Tablet Wireframes:**|

**Mobile Wireframes:**

### Flowcharts ###
I have decided to make a flowchart for the sign-in / register / delete account / change username and/or password process to completely understand each step of the process.

I have used !!!!! to make this flowchart which you can view below:

### Data Models ###
I also created a conceptual data model to get a feel for the needed entities, relationships and attributes, which have also helped me form the user stories.
